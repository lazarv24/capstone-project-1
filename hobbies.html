    <h1>My Personal Hobbies</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>For me coding is great, because It's like traveling to the space, and landing on another planet, where I can spend hours and hours enjoying my time and feel peace. And after that go back to our planet Earth :D</li>
        <li>Also I'm a big fan of sports, especially basketball, I feel the same way as coding. I'am a big fan of Red Star Belgrade.</li>
        <li>Reading books is something that I tend to practice, because you will never be the same person after you finished reading a good book.</li>
        <li>Watching Movies and Series</li>
        <li>Workout</li>
        <li>Running</li>
        <li>etc...</li>
    </ul>
